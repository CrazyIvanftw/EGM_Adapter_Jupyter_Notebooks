    "# Python egm adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Python version 2.7\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the point of an adapter program is to communicate with the egm server (which is the cap I'm putting on top of the robot controller). To do this, you're gonna have to use google protocol buffers to serialize and deseralize the messages sent between the server and this addapter. Because RobotStudio uses v2.4.1 protocol buffers, the decision was made to also use the same version for the rest of the communication. The problem is that v2.4.1 protocol buffers aren't supported in Python 3. So... if you're going to write an adapter in python, you're gonna have to use python 2. I'm sorry for that, but it is what is it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Python environment setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're cobbeling together old stuff together, there's a couple of things you might have to do to make your python2 environment work with google protocol buffers. The first to mention is that installing everything in your environment might confuse python about where the standard print output is and what the standard encoding is. I'm not completely sure why, but o fix that, I've added some resetting script at the begenning of everything. The second thing is the actual instalation of the libraries you'll need. Everything below that is commented out are the instalation commands. I suggest updating pip and setuptools first, then uninstalling google in your environment. Once you do that, try to run the force install of protocol buffers v2.4.1. That should work. If you're running these scripts in a jupyter notebook like I am, you can just uncomment the commands that start with: !{sys.executable} -m... If you're using this code to make a command line script or something, just run the command in your python environment (i.e. pip uninstall google) without the !{sys.executable} -m part. "
